 - I started creating a game board with 10 animals, so 20 cards in total. Then I applied the card flipping, with the animals name. 

 - Then I created the side bar with the players, which they can be added one by one. Then I made a select langage button with 7 languages: 
    - English
    - German
    - Czech
    - Portuguse
    - French
    - Spanish
    - Japanese

- My next step was to apply the language selector to the animals names on the cards, once the side bar was already working.

- I now set the game logic, though not entirely, once I am still deciding on how to display the final score, and still running some tests.
